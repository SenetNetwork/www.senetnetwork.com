        If either party takes any action or proceeding at law or in equity to enforce any provision of this Agreement,
        including an action for declaratory relief, or an action for damages for an alleged breach of any provision of
        this Agreement, or in any form relating to this Agreement, or any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing

      </p>
      <h3>20. Choice of law and venue</h3>
      <p>
        This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of each country, without regard to
        any conflict of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of other jurisdictions. You agree
        that any action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement shall be tried in a court located in the lawful
        jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <h3>21. General provisions</h3>
      <p>
        Except as provided herein, any modification to this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by both the Official
        and you. If any provision of this Agreement is for any reason invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, that
        provision will be cancelled and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain valid and binding. This
        Agreement expressly excludes the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
        Sale of Goods. Our failure to bring an action against you or others for breach of contract does not waive our
        right to bring an action for subsequent or similar breaches. You may not assign this Agreement or your rights
        hereunder, and any breach will be void without written permission from the Crown. This Agreement sets forth the
        entire agreement between the Official and you with respect to the Official, the Service, and the Game. This
        Agreement supersedes all prior agreements between the parties (including oral and written agreements). Regardless
        of whether this Agreement states otherwise, any breach, delay, or inability by the Official to perform its portion
        of the Official for reasons beyond the Official's reasonable control shall not be considered a breach of this
        Agreement. All notices provided by you or required by this Agreement must be emailed to hi@senetnetwork.io , Attn:
        Customer Center, and will be effective on the date received.
